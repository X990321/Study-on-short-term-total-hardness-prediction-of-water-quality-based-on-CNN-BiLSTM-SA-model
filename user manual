1. Use water quality testing equipment to sample water quality data.
2. The total hardness of water quality was predicted by CNN-BiLSTM-SA.
3.This study provided a powerful theoretical reference for the accurate prediction of the total hardness of water quality, and had important application prospects in water environment quality assessment and efficient management of water resources.
